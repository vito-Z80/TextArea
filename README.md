# TextArea

 Zx-Spectrum library (Text area)

 #### TODO
ON/OFF
- Save/Restore screen area
- Frame shadow
- Delete 'SPACE' at the beginning of a new line
- Beep char

Variants
- Drawing style
- Text variables (color,TAB,etc...)

#### Implemented by:

- Hyphenation mode
- Colors (text area, frame)
- Random position
- Calculate width/height (if not set)
- Standrd font address (#3C00 if not set)

###Warnings:
You must monitor the size of the text so as not to exceed 660 characters that can be placed on a 30x22 screen (a frame takes one character from each side of the text area)
